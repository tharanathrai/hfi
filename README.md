<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
The Human Freedom Index is used to paint a broad but accurate picture of what overall freedom in
the world entails. The problem of interest is determining what contributes to overall freedom and
representing it in a manner that can be understood. The main challenge rests with the large number of
attributes that are taken into account.

<h1>Scope</h1>
The goal is to achieve visualization for various aspects of the dataset to better the
understanding of the data via appropriate techniques and representations. Dimensionality Reduction
will have to be performed to ensure that the large number of attributes does not affect the
outcome of the same.<br><br>

Michelle Vivita and I worked on this exploratory data visualization project in 2019 for our undergraduate course in Data Mining and Data Warehousing.
